Repository for code related to analysis of large genetic datasets including analysis and visualization using site frequency spectra, variant segregation in global populations, allelic differentiation. 

* Analysis and visualization of site frequency spectra in many populations
* Calculate FST between pairs of populations using Hudson's estimator 
* Stratified random sampling to obtain background variation for matched variants (by global Minor Allele frequency, functional effect, or other features)
